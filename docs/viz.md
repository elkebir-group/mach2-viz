# Navigating the Visualizer

When you first open the visualizer, you will see a layout that looks like the following:

## Basic Functions

- **Toggle the solutions** with the dropdown menu in the top left.
- **Zoom, pan, and drag nodes** in both the tree and migration graph.
- **Hover corresponding nodes and edges**. When you hover over a node or edge in the migration graph, the corresponding edges in the clonal tree will highlight as well. Likewise vice versa.
- **Compare solutions** by opening up another visualizer window. This can be done by clicking the `+` bar on the right.
- **View the summary panel**. To view a summary graph of all solutions, click the `+` bar on the left.
- Though self-explanatory, you can rotate the migration graph, and reset the view if any changes were made on the view (panning, dragging, or dilation). For more information, press the `/` key for a help popup.

## Data-Dependent Functions

- **If you have an input tree in your data**
  - There will be an `input tree` button like in the example above. This will let you toggle between the input tree and the solution tree.
- **If you have multiple input trees**
  - You will also be able to select between input trees in the dropdown menu in the top of the window, just like you can in selection between solutions. See the example below.
