## To run MACH2-Viz Locally

- **Prerequisites**
  - Have `node` installed
- First clone this repository
- If you don't currently have an OpenSSL variable exported, we have found that running the following fixes it:
  - `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
- Run the following
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
- A localhost should start, and open automatically in your default browser with MACH2-Viz open.
